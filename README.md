# Fantasy Funball
## Setup 
Consider using a virtual environment; navigate to `fantasy_funball` directory and:
```python3 -m venv <virtual env name>```

Once set up, install required packages using requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Please add to this as you need more packages.

## Notes
Project has been set up with a default Django template, idea being that eventually 
this repo will be hosted somewhere (in the :cloud:) so need to be able to hit that.
